Title: The Impact of Artificial Intelligence on Modern Healthcare

__________
 (Article)
In this article I argue that artificial intelligence (AI) is a form of artificial intelligences that are not merely machines, but rather machines that do not have human input. It is possible to distinguish between the two. Artificial intelligentsia are machines not because they are good at things, or because human intuition is not the source of human knowledge, which is what they do, and because their aim is to create machines. AI is good because it does not possess a human element, because its goal is the knowledge of the human mind, not to be the "right" kind of machine, in which case it is better to allow that to happen. A machine that has human intelligence is more human than a machine capable of a specific human act, for, as the philosopher John Locke put it, there is no "human" in the body of an AI. In fact, humans are better at knowing what is in a body than machines who are just machines in that they have not yet become sentient.

The problem is that, even if AI are the best sort of machines we might wish to avoid, they may not be sufficiently human-like to keep us safe. Even if they can help, how can we ensure that their actions will not disrupt our lives? That is, if we do this, it will be in our best interest that our life and our health and well-being will suffer because of AI's role in society. (This is an argument I made with a friend who is on a mission to bring AI to the USA, where it has become a staple of our daily lives. She is also a strong believer in AI and believes that we should not worry about AI in general, nor do we need to worry that AI will destroy our civilization. This is very important, since it allows us to argue against AI.)
We should also ask how the various social problems of today are connected to those of tomorrow. We should ask what we would do if that were the case. And we can do so by looking at the problems that these problems have in common with the social conditions that make up today's society today. I have argued in my book that the challenges of modern society are interconnected. The problem of
